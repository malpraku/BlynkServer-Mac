# Blynk Server

This is an unofficial MacOS port, not from the Blynk itself.  
Some bugs may occur, please submit an issues report.

## Installation

This program requires [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) to operate the server.  
The rest of the installation is simply drag and drop to the Applications folder, and  
If there's a security warning from Apple, try to bypass them.

## Usage

Once the program's installed, open it and the program will show up a dialog box containing the Server IP (If doesn't, just put in your IP address through System Preferences). Click on OK, and wait for the server to start

If the server has already started, then just open up your browser (other than Google Chrome) and type in your IP address using the following format : https://your-ip-address:9443/ or from the dialog box before.

The login page will shows up. In order to increase the user experience, the admin's email address and password has been slightly modified from default. Just simply login with the credential below, and start using.

## Ports
The ports here are might probably different but,  
I personally use 8080 as the Hardware Port.

## Closing the Program
If you would like to end the process of the program, you might notice that the BlynkServer app is  
currently on Not Responding state. Just ignore it, the main server application is in the ServerLauncher process.

Go into the Apple's icon, choose Force Quit. Scroll down until  
you saw the ServerLauncher program and hit Force Quit. An error might shows up,  
but it doesn't matter. Just click on OK, and the server should've closed.
